# Nightowls App

<<<<<<< HEAD
This application utilizes the Yelp API and allows users to search for their favorite bars and dance clubs based on their location. A user's distance from the bar is determined by a seperate module which calculates the distance between two coordinates. Authenticated users can choose to add themselves to a bar, which will initiate a twitter post. If said user decides not to this bar, they may remove themselves as well. Authentication is handled with React Stormpath.
